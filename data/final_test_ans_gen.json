The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term.\nThe plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations. But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger. LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still haven't been obtained. Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $20 a share.\n",

Defense Minister Boonrawd Somtas would later provide the list of provinces, Surayud said.\n\"Martial law will be lifted in 41 provinces and remain in (the other) 35 provinces, due to both domestic and foreign security concerns, as well as concerns about drug smuggling and illegal immigration,\" Boonrawd later told reporters.\n",

The year-ago results have been restated to comply with government regulations.\nThe restructuring program is designed to increase the company's tangible capital ratio. It includes removing $242 million in good will from the books, issuing $150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $52 million in convertible bonds.\nDuring the third quarter, the company charged about $46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill, added $20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio. The company said its junk-bond portfolio after these moves had been reduced to less than 1% of assets.\n\n",

The United Nations faces a monumental task if it is to find and fly home tens of thousands of exhausted and terrorised refugees within a 60-day rebel deadline starting Thursday.\n",

If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems.\n",

For weeks the communist government has held such rallies almost daily.\n``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40 years of the blockade, armed invasions, sabotage and attempts to kill President Fidel Castro were for earlier generations,'' said Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written several books about Cuban emigration to the United States.\n",

From member station KQED, Auncil Martinez reports.\nExperts say the ground is so saturated it cannot absorb any more water. So that means soil will fall off in chunks and destroy anything in its path. In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today when tons of earth cascaded down a hillside, ripping two houses from their foundations. No one was hurt, but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they'll monitor the shifting ground. In the northern California town of Rio Nido, officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood. And in San Francisco, a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping toward the sea. Forecasters say the picture will get worse because more rains are on the way.
