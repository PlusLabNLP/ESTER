No one was hurt.\nIt took engineers six hours to fix the tram system and the Peak Tram company resumed service at about 4:20 p.m. (0820 GMT).\n",

    "context": "Along with reduced volume, analysts said the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped. Operating profit dropped 46% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment. Moreover, the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix.\nArmco shares closed unchanged at $10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nNational Intergroup, which owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million. Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept. 30 to $747.8 million from $623.5 million a year ago. The latest period includes gains of $9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward. Last year's results were hurt by $41.3 million in restructuring charges.\n",

Mr. Sarkozy has denied accepting illegal campaign funds from Ms. Bettencourt, either personally or through his party treasurer at the time, Eric Woerth, as alleged by her former butler. Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, called the judge's decision, which indicates that the judge believes that Mr. Sarkozy probably committed a crime, \"incoherent\" and \"unjust.\" The lawyer said he would appeal. The ruling does not necessarily mean that Mr. Sarkozy, who lost his re-election bid last May and with it his presidential immunity from prosecution, will stand trial.\n",
